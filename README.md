Some benefits of Data binding.

1) Update the values automatically.(doesn’t have to keep track of all the ways a value can be updated)

2) Very effective for UI Testing.

3) More readable code.

4) More maintainable code.

5) Faster development times.

6) Faster execution times.

7) Well suited for MVVM and MVI architectures.

8) Errors can be found during the compile time.

9) No limitations comparing with Kotlin synthetic(Such as everything exists In a global namespace, typing Isn’t guaranteed,  nullability will not be exposed, ....)
